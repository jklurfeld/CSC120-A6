Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance makes it easier to implement classes with some of the same functionality, and it saves you time. Since inheritance had already been introduced to me through the AP curriculum, the way it's being introduced now seems less trivial than how it was previously presented, which is good.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It took me a little bit of time to figure out how to implement the printCollection method because I thought couldn't approach it the same way as I would other problems where I just used a for loop, and in the end I just found how to do that for Hashtables. The rest of the project seemed pretty straightforward to me.
